# Query Node Integration - Technical Documentation

## Overview
The Query Node is a sophisticated natural language processing component that allows users to query the MongoDB database using conversational English instead of complex database queries.

## Architecture Integration

### 1. ReAct Workflow Enhancement
```
User Input ‚Üí Intent Analysis ‚Üí Access Control ‚Üí Query Node ‚Üí MongoDB ‚Üí Results
```

**Original Flow:**
- User Input ‚Üí Intent Analysis ‚Üí Access Control ‚Üí Data Collection ‚Üí API Endpoint

**Enhanced Flow with Query Node:**
- User Input ‚Üí Intent Analysis ‚Üí Access Control ‚Üí **Query Node** ‚Üí Direct MongoDB Query ‚Üí Formatted Results

### 2. Query Detection Process

#### Intent Analysis Enhancement (`_analyze_user_intent`)
```python
# Enhanced to detect query vs creation operations
{
    "operation_type": "create|query|update|general",
    "query_type": "count|list|find|search|aggregate|null",
    "natural_query": "extracted query intent for natural language processing"
}
```

#### Query Examples Detected:
- **Count Queries:** "How many users are registered?", "Total orders in June 2025?"
- **Find Queries:** "Show employee 37644 attendance", "When did John check in?"
- **List Queries:** "List all pending leave requests", "Show suppliers in California"
- **Search Queries:** "Find orders above $1000", "Show HR department employees"

## Implementation Details

### 3. Query Node Architecture (`_process_query_node`)

#### Natural Language to MongoDB Translation
```python
def _process_query_node(self, user_input: str, state: Dict, session_id: str):
    # 1. Extract query parameters from conversation state
    collection_name = state.get("detected_task")
    natural_query = state.get("natural_query", user_input) 
    query_type = state.get("query_type", "find")
    
    # 2. AI-powered MongoDB query generation
    # Uses Gemini AI to convert natural language to MongoDB syntax
    
    # 3. Execute query with proper access control
    # Validates user permissions before execution
    
    # 4. Format results for user presentation
    # Returns structured, readable results
```

#### AI Prompt Engineering
The system uses sophisticated prompts to convert natural queries:
```
"How many orders in June 2025?" 
‚Üí {"mongodb_query": {"created_at": {"$gte": "2025-06-01", "$lt": "2025-07-01"}}, "operation": "count_documents"}

"Show employee 37644 attendance" 
‚Üí {"mongodb_query": {"employee_id": "37644"}, "operation": "find", "projection": {"check_in": 1, "date": 1}}
```

### 4. Access Control Integration

#### Role-Based Query Access
```python
def validate_query_access(employee_id: str, collection_name: str):
    # 1. Validate employee exists in system
    # 2. Get employee position/role
    # 3. Check collection access permissions
    # 4. Return access decision with details
```

#### Access Control Matrix
| Role | Collections Accessible | Query Types |
|------|----------------------|-------------|
| Admin | All 49 collections | All query types |
| HR Manager | HR-related collections | Find, Count, List |
| Finance Manager | Finance collections | Find, Count, Aggregate |
| Director | Most collections | All query types |
| Regular Employee | Limited collections | Find only |

### 5. API Endpoints

#### Direct Query Endpoint (`/api/query`)
```json
POST /api/query
{
    "query": "How many users are registered?",
    "collection": "user_registration", 
    "employee_id": "EMP001",
    "session_id": "unique_session"
}
```

**Response Format:**
```json
{
    "status": "success",
    "response": "üî¢ Query Results\n\nFound **5** records matching your criteria.",
    "query_results": 5,
    "employee_id": "EMP001",
    "user_position": "Admin User",
    "collection": "user_registration"
}
```

#### Chat Integration (`/chat`)
Natural language queries work seamlessly through the chat interface:
```json
POST /chat
{
    "message": "How many training sessions were scheduled this month?",
    "session_id": "chat_session"
}
```

## Database Functions Enhancement

### 6. New Database Operations (`db.py`)

#### Query Execution Engine
```python
def execute_query(collection_name, query, operation="find", limit=50):
    # Supports: find, count_documents, aggregate
    # Includes: sorting, projection, pagination
    # Returns: formatted results with metadata
```

#### Collections Information
```python
def get_collections_info():
    # Returns: collection names, document counts, indexes
    # Used for: query validation and optimization
```

#### Access Validation
```python
def validate_query_access(employee_id, collection_name):
    # Validates: employee existence, role permissions
    # Returns: access decision with user details
```

## Query Examples for Interviews

### 7. Demonstration Queries

#### Business Intelligence Queries
```python
# Count-based queries
"How many users registered this month?"
"Total purchase orders pending approval?"
"Number of employees in HR department?"

# Find-specific records
"Show details for employee EMP001"
"When did John Doe last check in?"
"What's the status of purchase order PO12345?"

# List collections of data
"List all suppliers in California"
"Show pending leave requests for HR review"
"Display training sessions scheduled for next week"

# Complex filtering
"Find orders above $5000 from this quarter"
"Show employees with admin privileges"  
"List contracts expiring next month"
```

#### Access Control Demonstrations
```python
# Admin access (EMP001)
"Show all user registration records" ‚úÖ Full access

# HR Manager access (EMP002)  
"List employee leave requests" ‚úÖ HR collections
"Show payroll records" ‚ùå Finance-only collection

# Regular employee access
"View my attendance records" ‚úÖ Own records only
"See all company finances" ‚ùå Insufficient permissions
```
